1 Before you install:

	Currently, checks are available for CORDEX and CMIP5.
	If you wish to add checks for projects other than these:

	1.1 Add a line to the file 'availablechecks' in this manner:
		PROJECTNAME:projectdatanodelistfile
	1.2 Note that  the 'projectdatanodelistfile' has to contain the actual datanodes 
	where the data is published and not the index nodes, where data is presented.
	1.3 You can add support for projects even after the installation, by following steps 1.1 and 1.2,
	but by adding the line to the file 'activatedchecks' instead of 'availablechecks'.
	1.4 Send your changes to esg-admin@nsc.liu.se, so that they can be included into the git repo.

2 Installation:

	2.1 Simply run ./install.sh to install it.
	2.2 The script 'install.sh' is interactive and will ask you to provide:
		a. installation  directory 
		b. email id to send the cron outputs.
		c. projects you want to run checks for.
